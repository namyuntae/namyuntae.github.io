    <h2>What makes a hero?</h2>
    <p>
      Heroes are people we respect. They also show us what values we value the most in our lives. That's why we can get a glimpse of important values in a person's life if we look at individual heroes.

He made a global impact with this modernized dance pop and completely destroyed every wall regardless of race, age, or gender. He has made a huge impact on the world of pop music and given emotional comfort and happiness to many people.
